Thanks for looking at the Criteo Events SDK! It allows Android applications to easily send events
back to Criteo to power your targeted campaigns.

## Download

The Criteo Events SDK is available via:

### 1. JCenter AAR

The Events SDK is available as an AAR via JCenter; to use it, add the following to your `build.gradle`.

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.criteo.android:events-sdk:1.1.7'
}
```

Alternatively, you can directly download the .aar from JCenter and include it into your app as a new module.

### 2. Cloned GitHub repository

You can obtain the Event SDK source by cloning the git repository and including it into your app as a new module.  
`git clone git://github.com/criteo/android-events-sdk.git`

## Requirements

- Android 2.3 (API 9) or higher
- Google Play Services 7.5.0 or higher
